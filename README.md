# BabyFace
This software allows parents to monitor the resting heart rate of their children from a distance. The software, initially developed by MIT and Thearn, is a technique which has recently gained popularity in the field of AI and Biomedical Engineering. It decomposes the user's video feed into a variety of wavelengths and analyzes the quantity of pixels over time. After passing through a series of filters and magnification the code is unified and displayed on the screen (No credit taken for development of the technique, this was solely the work of MIT). 
After seeing this video for the first time, we decided that this idea could have vast applications; one of them being a baby health monitor. Most modern baby monitors simply detect sound to measure your baby's activity at any given time. With eulerian video magnification, it is possible to get a far more precise measure of the baby's health, heartbeat. 
This device, which would normally be mounted over a baby's crib, used the home's local wifi network to relay the transmission data to the parent's side. 
This application could have potentially life saving effects on many children who die every year in the United States due to unnoticed events. Since the heart beat is the best measure of a human's immediate health, then this application could be the best measure of your baby's health.

Future improvements: 
-Increase camera resolution to prevent spikes in BPM
-Integrate software with a node-red server in order to have access from anywhere.
-Utilizite text message alerts to notify parents of potential dangers.
